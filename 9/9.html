        The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for
        documents designed to be displayed in a web browser. It can be assisted by
        technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets and scripting languages such as
        JavaScript.

        Cascading Style Sheets is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation
        of a document written in a markup language such as HTML or XML. CSS is a
        cornerstone technology of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and JavaScript.

        JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a programming language that is one of the core
        technologies of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS. As of 2022, 98% of
        websites use JavaScript on the client side for webpage behavior, often incorporating
        third-party libraries.

    </button>
    <div id="DOM" hidden>
        The Document Object Model is a cross-platform and language-independent interface
        that treats an XML or HTML document as a tree structure wherein each node is an
        object representing a part of the document. The DOM represents a document with a
        logical tree.

        Dynamic HTML, or DHTML, is a term which was used by some browser vendors to
        describe the combination of HTML, style sheets and client-side scripts that enabled the
        creation of interactive and animated documents. The application of DHTML was
        introduced by Microsoft with the release of Internet Explorer 4 in 1997.
